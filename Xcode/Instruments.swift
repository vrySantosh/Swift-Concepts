/* Insturments in Xcode 

    Debugger: 
        This tool allows developers to find and fix issues in their code by inspecting the state of the app while it is running. 
        The debugger allows developers to set breakpoints, step through code, 
        and view the values of variables at different points in the execution of the app.

    Simulator: 
        This tool allows developers to test their apps on a variety of virtual iOS devices, 
        including different hardware configurations and operating system versions.

    Performance tools: 
        Xcode includes a number of performance tools that can help developers optimize the performance of their apps, 
        including the CPU profiler, the memory profiler, and the energy profiler.

            To use performance tools in Xcode, follow these steps:

                Open your Xcode project and navigate to the desired project file or workspace.

                In the top menu bar, select "Product" and then "Profile" or press "Command + I" on your keyboard. 
                This will launch the Instruments app and open the "Choose a Template" window.

                Select a template based on the type of performance analysis you want to perform. There are several templates available, 
                including "Time Profiler" for analyzing CPU usage, "Energy Diagnostics" for analyzing power usage, and "Memory Allocations" for analyzing memory usage.

                Click "Choose" to open the selected template and begin recording.

                Run your app and perform the desired actions. The Instruments app will collect data as you use your app.

                When you have completed your performance analysis, stop the recording by clicking the "Stop" button in the top left corner of the Instruments window.

                The Instruments app will display a timeline of your app's performance, 
                along with detailed information about CPU usage, power usage, memory usage, and other metrics. 
                Use the tools and features in the Instruments app to analyze this data and identify potential performance issues.

                Note: 
                    Some performance tools may require you to build and run your app in a specific way, 
                    or to enable certain options in your project's build settings. Be sure to read the documentation 
                    for each tool carefully to ensure that you are using it correctly.

    Test navigator: 
        This tool allows developers to create and run unit tests and user interface tests 
        to ensure the quality and reliability of their apps.

    Source control: 
        Xcode includes integration with popular source control systems such as Git and Subversion, 
        allowing developers to manage and track changes to their code.

    Asset catalog: 
        This tool allows developers to manage and organize the various assets used in their apps, 
        including images, icons, and colors.

    Interface Builder: 
        This tool allows developers to create and design the user interface of their apps 
        using a visual drag-and-drop interface.

    FileMerge: 
        This tool allows developers to compare and merge changes to their code, 
        making it easier to collaborate with other developers on a project.
