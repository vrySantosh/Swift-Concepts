/* Combine Framework:
    
    In Swift, the Combine framework provides a declarative Swift API for processing values over time. 
    It enables you to respond to changes in the value of a property, or to combine multiple publishers 
    and perform transformations on their values.
*/

// Here's a simple example of how you might use the Combine framework to monitor the value of a property:

import Combine

class SomeClass {
    var someProperty: Int = 0 {
        didSet {
            print("The value of someProperty changed to \(someProperty)")
        }
    }
}

let someObject = SomeClass()
someObject.someProperty = 42
// Prints "The value of someProperty changed to 42"

/* 
    In this code, the SomeClass class has a property called someProperty, which is of type Int. 
    The didSet observer for this property is used to print a message 
    whenever the value of the property changes.

    To use the Combine framework, you must import the Combine module at the top of your Swift file.

    In this example, when the someProperty property is set to 42, the didSet observer is triggered 
    and prints a message to the console. This demonstrates how you can use the Combine framework 
    to monitor the value of a property and respond to changes in its value.

    The Combine framework provides a number of other features and capabilities, 
    such as the ability to combine and transform multiple publishers, 
    and to cancel and resubscribe to publishers. 
    You can learn more about the Combine framework in the official documentation.
*/

/* 
    It provides a simple and elegant way to perform asynchronous operations in your Swift code.
*/

// Here is an example of using Combine to perform a simple asynchronous operation:

import Combine

// Create a publisher that emits a string "Hello, world!" after a 1-second delay
let publisher = Just("Hello, world!")
    .delay(for: 1.0, scheduler: DispatchQueue.main)

// Subscribe to the publisher and print each value it emits
let cancellable = publisher
    .sink(receiveCompletion: { completion in
        switch completion {
        case .finished:
            print("Publisher finished emitting values.")
        case .failure(let error):
            print("Publisher failed with error: \(error)")
        }
    }, receiveValue: { value in
        print("Received value: \(value)")
    })

// The subscription will remain active until it is cancelled
cancellable.cancel()

/* 
    In this example, we create a publisher using the Just publisher, 
    which emits a single value and then finishes. We then use the delay operator to 
    delay the emission of the value by 1 second. 
    Next, we use the sink method to subscribe to the publisher and receive the values it emits. 
    Finally, we use the cancel method to cancel the subscription.

*/


/* 
    In Swift, the Combine framework provides a declarative Swift API for processing values over time. 
    It can be used to manage asynchronous events and data streams in your Swift app, 
    and can be used to replace traditional delegation, target-action, and callback-based designs.

*/

// Here is an example of how you might use the Combine framework in a Swift app:

import Combine

class MyClass {
  // Create a cancellable subscription to track the stream of data.
  var subscription: Cancellable?
  
  func doSomething() {
    // Create a publisher to emit strings.
    let publisher = PassthroughSubject<String, Never>()
    
    // Use the sink operator to subscribe to the publisher and process the values it emits.
    subscription = publisher
      .sink { value in
        print("Received value: \(value)")
      }
    
    // Use the send() method to publish a value to the publisher.
    publisher.send("Hello, world!")
  }
}

/* In this example, we create a PassthroughSubject publisher that emits strings. 
    We then use the sink operator to subscribe to the publisher and process the values it emits. 
    In this case, we simply print each value to the console. 
    Finally, we use the send method to publish a value to the publisher.
